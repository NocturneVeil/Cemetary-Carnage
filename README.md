# Cemetery Carnage

## Overview
*Cemetery Carnage* is a small 3D survival game set in a spooky graveyard. The player must survive as long as possible while enemies spawn and chase them. This project was built as an experiment to learn the basics of 3D game development.

## Features
- Spooky 3D graveyard environment
- Player movement with simple controls
- Enemies spawn and chase the player
- Continuous survival loop until defeat

## Known Issues
- Buggy behavior â€” occasional crashes
- Long load times for assets
- Very basic gameplay (no combat, scoring, or win screen)
- Simple visuals and lighting
- Performance drops with too many enemies
- No sound or music

## Conclusion
While *Cemetery Carnage* is rough and limited, it still runs as a working prototype. It demonstrates the fundamentals of 3D environments, movement, and basic enemy AI, making it a solid learning milestone.
